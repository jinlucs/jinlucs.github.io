I am an assistant professor at the [School of Computing](https://www.cs.uga.edu/) at the University of Georiga, His major research interests include machine learning, data mining, optimization, smart mobility, biomedical informatics, and health informatics. He is particularly interested in transparent machine learning models, high-performance algorithms, and interpretable methods for critical scientific and engineering problems.

*PhD applicants*: If you're interested, you will need to 

1. Apply to the [School of Computing](https://www.cs.uga.edu/doctor-philosophy-computer-science) 
2. Select me as a potential advisor in your application. 

*Undergraduates/masters students*: If you are a UGA student and are interested in doing independent machine learning research, then I would recommend (1) take CSCI(PHIL) 4550/6550 (2) read this [blog post](https://www.alextamkin.com/essays/tips-for-new-researchers).
