I am an assistant professor at the [Department of Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania, working on debugging machine learning and making systems actually do what we want them to do. I'm also a part of the [ASSET Center](https://blog.seas.upenn.edu/penn-engineerings-new-asset-center-will-focus-on-the-safety-explainability-and-trustworthiness-of-ai-systems/) on safe, explainable, and trustworthy AI systems. Previously, I completed my PhD at CMU advised by [Zico Kolter](https://zicokolter.com/), and did a postdoc with [Aleksander Madry](https://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/). 

*PhD applicants*: If you're interested, you will need to 

1. Apply to the [CIS department](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/doctoral-program/) 
2. Select me as a potential advisor in your application. 

*Undergraduates/masters students*: If you are a UPenn student and are interested in doing independent machine learning research, then I would recommend (1) take CIS 5200 (2) read this [blog post](https://www.alextamkin.com/essays/tips-for-new-researchers). I would strongly recommend you take my special topics course, 3990-002 Mathematics for Machine Learning so that you are prepared for the mathematics behind the research. If you are not at UPenn, I do not currently have opportunities for external students. 

In Fall 2023, I will be teaching a special topics course 3990-002 Mathematics for Machine Learning. See course website [here](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~exwong/moml/). If you're interested in doing advanced research or graduate coursework in AI/machine learning but have taken only the core math requirements of the CS degree, then this course is for you.
